## Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection

`src/third_party/sgt-puzzles/` vendors the midend, shared libraries and the 40
official games of [Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle
Collection](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/) from
`https://git.tartarus.org/simon/puzzles.git` (commit recorded in
`src/third_party/sgt-puzzles/UPSTREAM`). It is copyright (c) 2004-2024 Simon
Tatham and the contributors listed in its `LICENCE`, and is distributed under
the MIT licence reproduced in `src/third_party/sgt-puzzles/LICENCE` and
`third_party/sgt-puzzles-docs/LICENCE`. Local fixes are kept as patches under
`patches/sgt/`. The display names, descriptions and objectives in
`src/games/sgt/upstream_meta.inc` come from its `CMakeLists.txt`.

## Fonts and font baking

The UI font is [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter), Copyright (c) 2016 The
Inter Project Authors, licensed under the SIL Open Font License 1.1
(`third_party/fonts/Inter-LICENSE.txt`, also shipped as
`assets/fonts/Inter-LICENSE.txt`). `assets/fonts/*.ppzfont` are distance-field
renderings of it produced by `tools/bake-fonts.sh`.

The baker uses [stb_truetype](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
(`third_party/stb/stb_truetype.h`, public domain or MIT). It is a host-only
tool and is not linked into the PS5 application.

## OpenGL runtime

The PS5 build statically links the
[ps5-opengl](https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ps5-opengl) SDK
(GPL-3.0-or-later), which contains Mesa (MIT) and OpenGNM PSBC components under
their own licenses. The SDK is fetched or selected at build time and is not
stored in this repository; its license texts ship inside the SDK archive.

## Native build dependencies

The application build uses LLVM/Clang/lld, zlib 1.3.2, and the public
[PS5 payload SDK](https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/sdk). The bootstrapper
downloads SDK v0.42 after verifying SHA-256
`8cfbc7cd5811e719eb4f0c47eea668d3dc7b40bc8ab11c4a5031d40c23ec02da`.
It downloads zlib 1.3.2 from the upstream source archive after verifying
SHA-256 `bb329a0a2cd0274d05519d61c667c062e06990d72e125ee2dfa8de64f0119d16`
and compiles its static archive locally. Both dependencies remain under ignored
`.deps/native/`, retain their upstream licenses, and are not distributed by
this repository. No Sony SDK file is included.

Target C++ compilation uses the LLVM libc++ headers distributed by the public
SDK. Those headers retain the Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception license recorded
upstream. The application does not redistribute or dynamically load the
complete libc++ or libc++abi archives.

The project’s PS5 ELF converter and FSELF writer are independently authored
GPL-3.0-or-later code. SharpProspero was a useful public format reference during
development but is not fetched, copied, linked, or required by the build.

## Host test dependency

The host unit-test target downloads
[GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) 1.17.0 after verifying
SHA-256 `65fab701d9829d38cb77c14acdc431d2108bfdbf8979e40eb8ae567edf10b27c`.
It remains under ignored `.deps/test/`, retains its BSD-3-Clause license, and
is not linked into any PS5 application, runtime, or package artifact.

## Optional PacBrew dependencies

When selected through `PACBREW_*` build variables, the build downloads the prebuilt ports image
from [ps5-payload-dev/pacbrew-repo](https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/pacbrew-repo)
release `v0.40.2`, verifies its published SHA-256, and extracts only the
`target/user/homebrew` prefix under ignored `.deps/pacbrew/`. It does not
replace the pinned SDK or install files globally. PacBrew recipes and every
linked third-party library retain their upstream licenses; applications must
review those terms before redistribution.

## Optional UFS2Tool dependency

When `.ffpkg` output is requested, the platform bootstrapper fetches
[SvenGDK/UFS2Tool](https://github.com/SvenGDK/UFS2Tool) at commit
`b5307a60d5b4e3a68ba680e0e33cfadf05017c77` into the ignored
`.deps/UFS2Tool` cache and builds it with the host .NET SDK. UFS2Tool is
BSD-2-Clause software and is not distributed by this repository.

## Optional MkPFS dependency

When `.ffpfsc` output is requested, the platform bootstrapper fetches
[PSBrew/MkPFS](https://github.com/PSBrew/MkPFS) at commit
`6cb8313dfe0c988ac52617794553f343243d3a56` into the ignored `.deps/MkPFS`
cache and installs its Python dependencies into an ignored virtual environment
there. MkPFS and its dependencies retain their own licenses and are not
distributed by this repository.

## Independently authored runtime shim

`tooling/native/libc_builder.cpp` and the manifests under
`tooling/native/runtime/` are independently authored for this project and
licensed under GPL-3.0-or-later. The generated `runtime/libc.prx` contains
project-authored compatibility stubs, startup code, and semantic loader
metadata. It contains no Sony runtime implementation.

Original ps5-native-app-boilerplate code is Copyright (C) 2026

## Original presentation assets

The BlackBear icon, selection artwork, and default selection track
`sce_sys/snd0.at9` are original assets supplied by BlackBearReloaded, Copyright
(C) 2026 BlackBearReloaded, and distributed under GPL-3.0-or-later. The track
is titled `Night Drive`.

No proprietary runtime module, encryption key, or game file is included.
